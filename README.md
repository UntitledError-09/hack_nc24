- Flask-RESTful
- Flask-PyMongo
- Flask-JWT-Extended
- pymongo

## Installation

1. Install the required Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip install Flask Flask-RESTful Flask-PyMongo Flask-JWT-Extended pymongo
    ```

2. Update the MongoDB URI and JWT secret key in `server.py`:

    ```python
    app.config['MONGO_URI'] = "your-mongodb-uri"
    app.config['JWT_SECRET_KEY'] = 'your-secret-key'
    ```

## Usage
